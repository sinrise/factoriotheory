amount of beacons = 12
distribtion efficiency = 0.5
amount of speed modules = 2
speed bonus = 50% = 0.5

crafting speed = 1.25
amount of speed modules = 0
amount of produc modules = 4
speed bonus from produc modules = -15% = -0.15
speed bonus from speed modules = 50% = 0.5
produc bonus = 40% = 0.4

produc amount = 1
recipe time = 20

I want per min = 10

The Math:

bonus speed from beacon = amount of beacons * amount of speed modules * speed bonus * distribtion efficiency = 6

bonus speed from machine = ( amount of speed modules * speed bonus from speed modules ) + ( amount of produc modules * speed bonus from produc modules ) = -0.6

final crafting speed bonus = crafting speed * ( bonus speed from beacon + bonus speed from machine ) = 6.75

final crafting speed = crafting speed + final crafting speed bonus = 8

final produc bonus = produc bonus * amount of produc modules = 1.6

final recipe time = recipe time / final crafting speed = 2.5

products per second = produc amount / final recipe time = 0.4

final products per second = final produc bonus + products per second = 0.64

products per min = final products per second * 60 = 38.4

final score = I want per min / products per min = ~0.26
